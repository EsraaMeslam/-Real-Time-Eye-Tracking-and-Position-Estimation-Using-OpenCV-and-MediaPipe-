# Real-Time Eye Tracking and Position Estimation

## Overview
This project implements a real-time eye-tracking system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The code tracks the user's eye position (left, right, or center) and displays it on the screen. The system works by detecting facial landmarks, extracting eye regions, and estimating the eye's position based on pixel analysis.

## Files
Eye_Tracking.py: Main script that captures video input, processes each frame to detect eyes, and estimates eye position.
utils.py: Utility functions for drawing colored backgrounds and text on images.
